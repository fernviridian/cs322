CS322 Languages and Compiler Design II                       Homework 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This homework assignment is due on Monday, April 20.  You may
submit your solution in one of two ways:

- By uploading a single pdf or text file to the D2L dropbox by 3pm
  that afternoon.  OTHER FILE FORMATS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED, so
  please do not submit a document in another format such as Word,
  OpenOffice, or Pages, and do not submit source or executable
  code or zip/tar/etc. archive files.

- By turning in a solution on paper (handwritten, printed, or a
  combination of the two) at the start of the lecture (4:40pm)
  on that day.

You should use the materials from the demonstration compiler,
DemoComp, as your primary resource for this assignment.  The
DemoComp source code is available from the Week 2 section of the
Course Content on D2L, and includes the As, Ps, Is, and B folders
from the Interpretour, as well as the At, Pt, It, and C folders
from the Week 2 lecture.  In particular, you should use the code
in the C folder as your starting point for this assignment.  The
DemoComp.zip file contains additional directories (such as Demo
and BDemo) but you can safely ignore those for the purposes of
this assignment; they are not required here.

Although I am assuming that you have completed the Interpretour
prior to starting this assignment, you will not need to include
any code from the DT, Nest, Proc, Ref, or FCF steps of that lab
for this assignment.

The maximum possible score for this assignment is 50 points.
Students must receive at least 10 points to satisfy the minimum
grading requirement for this assignment (as specified in the
course syllabus).


Question 1: [25 points]
-----------
Modify the DemoComp compiler to include support for the following
constructs in the source language.  You are welcome/encouraged to
extend or modify the target language implementation also if you
find that it is useful to do so.  For example, it may be easier to
compile some constructs in the source language if you add a new
instruction in the target language.

- A multiplication operator that takes two integer arguments and
  returns their product (another integer) as its result.  [Hint:
  you have already done something very similar to this in the
  Warmup stage of the Interpretour; the key extension here will be
  to add a suitable implementation of the compileTo() method for
  your Mult class.] DONE

- A not operator that takes a single Boolean argument and returns
  its inverse as a result (i.e., mapping true to false and false
  to true). DONE

- A less than or equal operator, <=, that operates on two integer
  arguments and returns a Boolean result.  [Hint: you can
  implement this easily without having to modify the target
  language ...] DONE

- An even operator that takes a single integer argument and
  returns a Boolean that is true if, and only if , the input
  argument is an even number.   For example, even(2) and even(7)
  would return true and false, respectively. 

- A halve operator that takes an integer argument and returns an
  integer result that is the result of dividing the input value by
  two.  For example, halve(2) and halve(7) would return 1 and 3,
  respectively.

In each case, you are encouraged to build up your solution by
following the pattern that was illustrated in lectures: start by
defining the abstract syntax class, then add code for printing,
evalation/execution, and compilation.  Your answer should explain
any changes and additions that you make at each stage, and it
should provide evidence of thoughtful testing.  ("Thoughtful
testing" does not require the use of a large test suite, but
instead relies on careful selection of key tests, with
justification, and with commentary to explain how the results of
testing help to demonstrate that the solution is correct.) You
should include key code fragments to document your answer but full
code listings are *not* required.  A student who submits *only*
code listings for this part of the assignment, even if those
implementations are (or at least appear to be) correct, will not
likely receive full points for this part of the assignment.

Question 2: [10 points]
-----------
Consider the following program, written using a hypothetical concrete
syntax for the DemoComp compiler’s source language.

    t = 0; x = 6; y = 7;
    while (0<x) {
      if (not(even(x))) {
        t = t + y;
      } else {
        t = t;
      }
      y = y + y;
      x = halve(x);
    }
    print t;

In this code, we have written not(e), even(e) and halve(e) as
concrete syntax for uses of the corresponding operators defined in
Question 1, each with an argument e.

Draw a diagram that shows the abstract syntax for the body of the
while loop in this code fragment.  Write a Java program, following
the pattern in the original Main class, that:

- constructs the abstract syntax tree for the full program above;

DONE

- executes it directly using the source language interpreter;

- translates it into the target language, printing out the result;
  and

- executes the resulting target code.

Use the output from the compiler to confirm both that you have
constructed the correct abstract syntax tree and that the
resulting target program has the same semantics.   [Do not be
surprised if you are able to reuse much of the code that has
already been provided.]

[P.S.  For fun, not credit: What does the program above actually
do?  What testing strategy could you use to confirm this?]

Question 3: [15 points]
-----------
Study the target code that your modified version of DemoComp
produces for the program that was shown in Question 2.  Identify
three distinct ways in which you think that code might reasonably
be improved by the use of a more sophisticated code generator
and/or optimizer.  [If you can see more than three possible
answers, pick the three that you think are most interesting and/or
most likely to be useful in practice.]

Three ways of impovement:

-r12 <- 0
  [t] <- r12
  assigns are inefficient
- 

-mult/divide bit shift instead of doing expensive integer mult/div
